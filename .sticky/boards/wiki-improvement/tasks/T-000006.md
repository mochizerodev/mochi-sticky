Goal: Track wiki page changes and versions using Git for better change management.

Scope:
- Implement `mochi-sticky wiki history <page>` command
- Show Git commit history for specific wiki pages
- Display author, date, and commit message for each change
- Add `wiki diff <page> <commit1> <commit2>` to compare versions
- Show last modified info in TUI page list
- Add `--since <date>` flag to filter history
- Generate changelog from Git commits between versions
- Integrate with wiki export to include version metadata

Acceptance:
- Can view complete Git history for any wiki page
- Shows who changed what and when
- Diff view shows side-by-side comparison
- TUI displays last modified date and author
- Changelog generation works from Git history
- Works seamlessly with standard Git workflows
- Handles pages with complex history (renames, moves)
