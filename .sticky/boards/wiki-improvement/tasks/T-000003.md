Goal: Track changes to wiki pages so exports/diffs can be reviewed before publishing.

Scope:
- Store a lightweight history for each page (timestamp, author, summary) and allow inline diff previews.
- Surface history/diff info in the TUI before exports and offer MCP commands to fetch diffs programmatically.
- Tie history data to exports so release notes can mention what changed since the last publish.

Acceptance:
- Each wiki page has a recorded edit history that the CLI/TUI can display (with simple diff highlights).
- MCP exposes commands to fetch the last N diffs and preview changes between versions.
- Export workflows can reference history metadata to auto-populate changelog snippets.
