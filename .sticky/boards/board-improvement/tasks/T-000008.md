Goal: Let board configurations be templatized so reusable column sets and metadata can be shared across feature-focused boards.

Scope:
- Allow boards to declare templates (column definitions, swimlane rules, default tags) that can be applied when a new board is created.
- Provide CLI/MCP helpers to list, preview, and apply templates, and keep templates versioned alongside `.sticky`.
- Ensure existing boards can opt in to templates without losing custom tweaks.

Acceptance:
- Templates capture column layouts, titles, and priority defaults and can be selected during board creation or via a config update.
- The CLI/TUI exposes commands to list templates, view their contents, and apply them to an active board without manual YAML edits.
- Template definitions persist under `.sticky/templates/` (or equivalent) so they stay with the repo and can be shared with teammates.
