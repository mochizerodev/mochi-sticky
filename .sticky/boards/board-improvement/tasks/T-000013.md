Goal: Implement work-in-progress (WIP) limits for workflow optimization.

Scope:
- Add `wip_limit` field to column configuration
- Display WIP count/limit in TUI column headers
- Prevent moving tasks to full columns (configurable)
- Add visual warning when approaching limit (yellow at 80%)
- Add `--force` flag to override WIP limits
- Track WIP limit violations in metrics
- MCP integration for WIP limit queries

Acceptance:
- Columns can have optional WIP limits
- TUI shows current count vs limit
- Can configure strict or warning-only enforcement
- Helps teams identify bottlenecks
- Limits are respected in CLI and TUI
