Goal: Give each board quick visibility into readiness (blocked vs ready) so stakeholders understand the release status at a glance.

Scope:
- Track dependency/blocked signals (from the dependencies improvement) and surface counts or badges in the board header/state.
- Provide CLI/TUI commands that summarize blockers, dependents, and tasks grouped by readiness.
- Add metrics like “ready %, blocked count, overdue tasks” that refresh along with the board view.

Acceptance:
- Boards display readiness summaries (counts/percentages) alongside columns in the TUI and CLI output.
- MCP exposes endpoints that return readiness metrics so other tools can surface them.
- Metrics update automatically when tasks change status or dependencies are resolved.
