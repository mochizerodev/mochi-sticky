Goal: Create comprehensive board metrics dashboard for insights.

Scope:
- Implement `mochi-sticky board metrics` command
- Display metrics: cycle time, lead time, throughput, WIP
- Show task distribution by status/priority/tag
- Track velocity (tasks completed per week)
- Generate charts (ASCII art or export to CSV)
- Historical trend analysis
- Filter metrics by date range

Acceptance:
- Can view board metrics summary
- Metrics are accurate and useful
- Charts are readable in terminal
- Can export metrics data for external tools
- Historical data is tracked over time
