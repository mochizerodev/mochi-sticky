Goal: Allow custom ordering of columns in board configuration.

Scope:
- Add `order` field to column config
- Support drag-and-drop column reordering in TUI
- Add `mochi-sticky board column move <key> <position>` command
- Preserve column order in config.yaml
- Update TUI rendering to respect order
- Ensure order doesn't break task status references

Acceptance:
- Columns can be reordered via config or command
- TUI displays columns in configured order
- Order persists across sessions
- Reordering doesn't affect existing tasks
- Default order is maintained for new boards
