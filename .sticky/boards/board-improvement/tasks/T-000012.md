Goal: Add swimlane support for grouping tasks horizontally.

Scope:

- Support grouping by: assignee, tag, priority, custom field
- Update TUI to display horizontal swimlanes
- Add swimlane filtering in CLI
- Allow drag-and-drop between swimlanes in TUI
- Persist swimlane assignments
- MCP support for swimlane operations

Acceptance:
- Board can be configured with swimlanes
- TUI displays tasks grouped in swimlanes
- Can move tasks between swimlanes
- Swimlanes work with existing column layout
- Configuration is backwards compatible
