## Done Summary (2026-02-05)
- Added `.golangci.yml` with required core linters enabled.
- Added `Makefile` with build/test/lint/install/coverage/clean targets.
- Added `.editorconfig`.
- Added GitHub templates: issue templates, PR template, and Dependabot config.
- Added release workflow to build/upload cross-platform artifacts on GitHub Releases.
- Added `CHANGELOG.md` scaffold.
- Improved `.gitignore` (coverage, dist, cache, logs).
- Updated README badges (Go version + Go Report Card) and dev dependency notes.
- Documented `pre-commit` usage in CONTRIBUTING and coding standards wiki.
- Added ADR config context-aware save path and wired ADR creation to it.
- Wired TUI task/board actions (create/update/archive/delete, loads) to use cancellable in-flight contexts.
- Upgraded Go toolchain requirement to 1.23.12 and added govulncheck CI job.
- Added architecture diagrams and release notes template to the built-in wiki.
- Migrated `docs/` content into the built-in wiki and removed `docs/`.
- Added `mochi-sticky version` and `--version` output with build metadata.
- Documented versioning plan and release stamping in the wiki.

## Context/Cancellation Work
- Wiki: context-aware variants for export/search/PDF; pandoc is killed on cancel; export writes now respect ctx.
- Board repo: context-aware variants for create/update/delete tasks, bulk archive, and list operations.
- Board registry: context-aware variants for create/rename/set-active/archive/delete, plus registry/init paths.
- ADR: context-aware variants for create + status update; config save now respects context; CLI uses Ctrl+C cancellable contexts for ADR create/move.
- Templates: context-aware seeding (`SeedDefaultsContext`) and `mochi-sticky init` uses it (Ctrl+C cancel).
- MCP: request context is threaded through dispatch; long-running handlers (list tasks/archived/ready, search/export wiki, create/update/delete task, board ops) honor cancellation.
- CLI: task/board write operations now use cancellable contexts.
- TUI: task/board actions + wiki load/export operations are cancellable; in-flight loads/exports are canceled on refresh/new action and when leaving wiki (esc/q/b).

## Remaining (not yet completed)
- Increase coverage toward target (add tests/golden files/benchmarks).
- Add coverage badge once a coverage service is chosen.
