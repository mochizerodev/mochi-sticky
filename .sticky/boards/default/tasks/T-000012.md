Goal: Add time tracking capabilities to measure effort and productivity.

Scope:
- Add time tracking fields: `time_estimate`, `time_spent`, `time_logged`
- Implement `mochi-sticky task time <id> --log <duration>` command
- Support duration formats: 30m, 2h, 1d
- Track time entries with timestamps in task history
- Add time summary in TUI (estimated vs actual)
- Generate time reports per board/tag/date range

Acceptance:
- Can log time entries for tasks
- Time spent is accumulated correctly
- TUI shows time estimates and actuals
- Can generate time reports for analysis
- Export includes time tracking data
