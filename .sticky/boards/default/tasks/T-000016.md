Goal: Make GitHub collaboration smooth (triage, contribution flow, and consistent PR quality).

Scope:
- Add issue templates (bug report, feature request) under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.
- Add `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` with checklist (tests, docs, changelog).
- Add a baseline label taxonomy (bug, enhancement, docs, good first issue, help wanted, security).
- Add `CODEOWNERS` (optional) or maintainers list / review rules.

Acceptance:
- New issues/PRs have guided templates.
- Labels exist and match the project’s triage workflow.
- A newcomer can open a PR and understand expectations from the template.
