Goal: Offer a CLI command that summarizes board readiness, watchers, pending exports, and any config warnings so we can assess health from scripting.

Scope:
- Implement a `status` (or `health`) CLI command that calls into the core metrics (readiness, blocked tasks, pending exports) and prints a concise summary.
- Include warnings when storage overrides, board descriptions, or export pipelines are misconfigured.
- Make the command emit machine-readable output (JSON) so automation can ingest it before running TUI or MCP jobs.

Acceptance:
- `mochi-sticky status` shows readiness, blocking counts, export queue state, and config health.
- The command has a `--json` flag for automation, outputting structured data matching the summary fields.
- Tests or docs show how to call the command before launching the TUI or release workflows.
