Goal: Add backup and restore functionality for data safety.

Scope:
- Implement `mochi-sticky backup create` command
- Create timestamped backups in `.sticky/backups/`
- Compress backups (tar.gz)
- Add `mochi-sticky backup list` command
- Add `mochi-sticky backup restore <timestamp>` command
- Automatic backup before destructive operations
- Configurable backup retention policy
- Exclude .gitignore files from backups

Acceptance:
- Can create manual backups
- Automatic backups before board/task deletion
- Backups are compressed and timestamped
- Can restore from any backup
- Old backups are cleaned up per retention policy
- Backup doesn't include temp/log files
