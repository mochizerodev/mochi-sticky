Goal: Capture telemetry around build/release pipeline runs so multi-platform regressions surface quickly.

Scope:
- Log durations/results per platform (Linux/Windows/macOS), including build/test/export steps, in a consistent format.
- Emit telemetry when GitHub Actions jobs start/finish, capturing config used, branch/tag, and artifact sizes.
- Provide hooks for CLI/TUI to display recent release telemetry (success rate, slowest step) in dashboards.

Acceptance:
- Build/release commands record structured logs for each platform and pipeline stage.
- CLI/TUI can read the logs and summarize timings/failures in a brief report.
- Documentation explains where logs live and how to interpret them (e.g., linking to CI artifacts).
