Goal: Analyze impact of ADR changes on architecture.

Scope:
- Implement `mochi-sticky adr impact <id>` command
- Show all ADRs superseded by given ADR
- Show all ADRs that supersede given ADR
- List related/dependent ADRs
- Identify orphaned ADRs (no relationships)
- Suggest ADRs that should be updated
- Track ADR age and staleness

Acceptance:
- Can analyze impact of any ADR
- Shows complete relationship tree
- Identifies potential issues (orphans, staleness)
- Helps maintain ADR consistency
- Suggestions are actionable
