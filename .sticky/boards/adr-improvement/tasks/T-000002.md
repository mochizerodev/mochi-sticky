Goal: Visualize ADR relationships and supersession chains.

Scope:
- Implement `mochi-sticky adr graph` command
- Generate DOT format for Graphviz
- Display relationships: supersedes, related to, depends on
- Show ADR status with color coding
- Support export to PNG/SVG via Graphviz
- Add interactive TUI graph navigation
- Highlight critical decision paths

Acceptance:
- Can generate ADR relationship graph
- Graph shows supersession chains clearly
- Status is visually distinguishable
- Can export to image formats
- Graph helps understand architecture evolution
